## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Labs: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

## Prerequisites

{{% resource_link "f6dc9a1c-395c-44db-b3fa-f42ff7718710" "*2.001 Mechanics and Materials I*" %}}

{{% resource_link "06658a8a-56df-4dfc-8e36-8120d4fb5854" "*2.670 Mechanical Engineering Tools*" %}}

## Course Description

This course develops students' competence and self-confidence as design engineers. It emphasizes the creative design process bolstered by application of physical laws. Robustness and manufacturability are emphasized, too. Students will learn how to complete projects on schedule and within budget. Subject relies on active learning via a major design-and-build project.

From its beginnings in 1970, the 2.007 final project competition has grown into an Olympics of engineering.  See this {{% resource_link "0d8cc87e-e9b3-43b4-88e8-615c4857744e" "MIT News story" %}} for more background, a photo gallery, and videos about this course.

## Milestones

- Learning objective: Become proficient in the the design process, analysis + synthesis = robot
- Ten assignments throughout the semester
- Progress from strategy → concept → most critical module → integrated machine → iteration and finished machine

## Physical Homework

- Learning objective: Physically connect lecture content to implementation, build competence in lab, confidence in competition
- Based on mini-me robot, minimal building, maximum thinking
- Five problems: CAD design, bench-level prototype, CG placement, autonomous control, motor power

## Written Homework

- Learning objective: Experience real-life, unbounded design problems and understand how to use engineering theory to analyze them (without a recipe)
- Will help develop your analysis + synthesis skills, retain course material, improve competition robot design
- Five written homework sets that relate to the first six weeks of class content

## Exam and Quizzes

- Learning objective: Provide additional iteration loop and personal reflection on lecture content
- Exam will cover all lecture content before spring break
- Quiz 1 will cover two lectures on 2.007 theory applied to real-world problems
- Quiz 2 will be a reflection on careers in design
